**State Crime Command (SCC)** is a specialized division dedicated to the investigation and resolution of serious crimes, including homicides, across the state of San Andreas. SCC officers are highly trained in forensic science and work independently from standard police departments to conduct detailed crime scene investigations.

The SCC leverages advanced forensic techniques to uncover the truth behind suspicious deaths and injuries. By collecting and analyzing physical evidence left at crime scenes—such as bullet casings, blood samples, and trajectories—SCC is able to piece together what really happened. Officers within this division also cross-reference evidence with the **Criminal Database** and can identify murder weapons on scene to assist in building strong cases.
